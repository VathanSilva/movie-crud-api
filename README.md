# movie-crud-api
This app is built using Node.js and Express.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side, while Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js. Together, they provide a powerful and efficient platform for building the backend of this generative image app.

We use Express.js to handle routing and handle HTTP requests, and to set up an API endpoint that the frontend can use to make requests to the OpenAI API. Node.js and Express.js also provide a range of modules and middleware that we use to handle things like parsing JSON data, handling file uploads, and more. By using Node.js and Express.js, we are able to quickly and easily build a scalable, efficient backend that can handle the demands of the generative image app.

Running the server
open a terminal and run the following command:

npm install
which will allow installing the project's dependencies. Still in the terminal run:

npm run dev
to run the developement server.
